## streaming-dload

`streaming-dload` is a GUI tool for working with devices in Qualcomm Streaming DLOAD mode. This mode allows for flash/emmc recovery in a bricked state. Streaming DLOAD is not available by most devices by default. It is only enterable when a device is in EDL mode and requres a EDL program to recover the flash device. This is generally uploaded by Sahara mode. After transfering firmware in EDL mode, execution is transfered to the uploaded programmer file. In a lot of cases this is Streaming DLOAD but it may be firehose which is a newer protocol.
